# llm-topics
This repo is for experimenting with novel options for topic mmodelling with large-language models and transformers, as well as qualitative and quantitative comparison with already existent topic modelling approaches.
Please do not use any of this code in production, it is solely for my Bachelor thesis, and will probably result in production-ready solutions in the future :)
